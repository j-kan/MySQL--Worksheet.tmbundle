The simplest of all possible SQL bundles....

Edit the environment variables in the preferences to the values for your database.
Then open a file (your "worksheet"), type a SQL query, select it, and do "MySQL execute".  
The query results are written back to the same worksheet.  That's basically it.

Update 2011/1/14: Now with a new clever feature/cheesy hack!  If you name your worksheet 
file something like "worksheet.<database-name>.sql", then queries will automatically go 
to that database -- so you can keep separate worksheets for different databases.
